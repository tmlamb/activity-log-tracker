Use when adding or reviewing @expo/ui Host/RNHostView trees, building native-feeling UI where standard React Native components fall short (lists with swipe actions and sections, settings forms with toggles, menus, sheets, pickers, sliders), choosing between universal and platform-specific components, or replacing an RN community UI library with a native @expo/ui equivalent. Not for custom native modules, Expo Router navigation, Reanimated, or data fetching."

# Expo UI (`@expo/ui`)

`@expo/ui` renders real native UI from React: SwiftUI on iOS, Jetpack Compose on Android. Start with its universal components (one tree for iOS, Android, and web) and drop to platform-specific SwiftUI/Jetpack Compose only when the universal layer falls short. It also ships drop-in replacements for migrating off RN community UI libraries.

> These instructions track the latest Expo SDK. The **universal** layer requires **SDK 56+**. Drop-in replacements and the platform-specific layers also exist on SDK 55. For component details on a specific SDK, refer to the Expo UI docs for that version.

## Installation

```bash
npx expo install @expo/ui
```

On SDK 56, `@expo/ui` works in Expo Go, so `npx expo start` runs it directly — no custom build required. On older SDKs, build a dev client first (`npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android`).

Every `@expo/ui` tree — universal or platform-specific — must be wrapped in `Host`.

## Choosing an approach (read this first)

Work down this list and stop at the first layer that meets the need:

1. **Universal components — start here.** Import from the `@expo/ui` root. One component tree runs unmodified on iOS, Android, and web from a single source (Compose on Android, SwiftUI on iOS, `react-native-web`/`react-dom` on web). No platform file splits. → `./references/universal.md`

2. **Platform-specific (SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose).** Import from `@expo/ui/swift-ui` or `@expo/ui/jetpack-compose`. Use **only** when the universal layer is missing a component or modifier you need, or when you need platform-specific behavior or optimization. **Downside:** you write two trees and split them into `.ios.tsx` / `.android.tsx` files (or branch on `Platform.OS`) — more code to maintain. → `./references/swift-ui.md` and `./references/jetpack-compose.md`

**Already using an RN community UI library?** `@expo/ui` also ships **drop-in replacements** — API-compatible swaps for popular libraries (`@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, and more), imported from `@expo/ui/community/<name>`. This is a migration side-path for replacing an existing dependency, not a step in the universal-vs-platform decision above. → `./references/drop-in-replacements.md`
